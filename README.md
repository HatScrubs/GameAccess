# Updates and News
You can check a few places for updates about the site.  We have an account on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hatscrubscriber) that we will announce releases on.  You can also look at the [releases](https://github.com/HatScrubs/GameAccess/releases) section here.

# Translations
If you would like to translate this site into your language, please consider helping us.  In this site you will see an "en" folder.  This contains every piece of text the site displays.  To translate, recreate each file and keep the keys the same.  Anyfile the language doesn't have will fallback to en.  If you have any questions on how exactly to do this, just hit me (stygiansabyss) up.
