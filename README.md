# Updates and News
You can check a few places for updates about the site.  We have an account on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hatscrubscriber) that we will announce releases on.  You can also look at the [releases](https://github.com/HatScrubs/GameAccess/releases) section here.

# Translations
If you would like to translate this site into your language, please consider helping us.  In this site you will see an "en" folder.  This contains every piece of text the site displays.  To translate, recreate each file and keep the keys the same.  Anyfile the language doesn't have will fallback to en.  If you have any questions on how exactly to do this, just hit me (stygiansabyss) up.

## How to translate

* Fork (the button at the top of this page) this repo.
* Clone the repo locally.
  * You can do this with [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) which works on mac AND windows.
* Copy the en folder and rename it to the common 2 character name for the language you are making.  (German would be de and Russian would be ru for example).
* Translate any files you can.
  * The keys are the parts to the left of the '=>' symbols.  Do not change the keys.
  * Change the text to the right of the '=>' symbol.  This is the text that is displayed on the pages.
* Once you are done, if you forked the project, submit a pull request back to this repo.
  * You can do so [here](https://github.com/HatScrubs/GameAccess/compare).
  * The base drop down should be set to master on this repo.
  * The compare drop down should be the branch with your changes.
* If you downloaded the zip,
